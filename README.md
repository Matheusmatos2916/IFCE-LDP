# Programming Laboratory in C
This repository contains the code and materials for a programming laboratory in C. The laboratory covers the basics of C programming, including data types, control structures, functions, arrays, and pointers.

Getting Started
To get started with the laboratory, you'll need to have a C compiler installed on your computer. We recommend using GCC, which is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Once you have a C compiler installed, you can clone this repository and open the lab files in your favorite text editor. Each lab consists of a set of exercises and a set of tests to verify that your solutions are correct.

Labs
Here's a brief overview of the labs included in this repository:

Lab 1: Introduction to C. In this lab, you'll learn the basics of C programming, including data types, operators, and control structures.
Lab 2: Functions and Arrays. In this lab, you'll learn how to define and use functions in C, as well as how to work with arrays.
Lab 3: Pointers and Dynamic Memory Allocation. In this lab, you'll learn about pointers and how to use them to create dynamic data structures.
Each lab builds on the concepts covered in the previous labs, so it's important to complete them in order.
